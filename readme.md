# fastapi-route-logger

Basic middleware to log requests made to routes in FastAPI applications.

## Installation

```
pip install fastapi-route-logger-middleware
```

## Usage

The component is FastAPI middleware.

```pythonstub
app.add_middleware(RouteLoggerMiddleware)
```

Additional arguments can be provided, when needed:

- `logger` - The Logger instance to use. Defaults to the default logger (`logging.getLogger(__name__)`).
- `skip_routes` - A list of strings that represent the start of routes that should not be logged. Default is an empty
  list. This is a "begins with" type match so an entry of `"/health"` will block the routes `/health/check` and `/healthcheck`.
- `skip_regexes` - A list of regex strings that will be matched against routes that should not be logged. Default is an empty
  list. This uses compiled regexes and matches against the entire path. An entry of `".*/health"` will not log the routes `/health` and `/api/1.0/health`.

The [sample-site](https://github.com/jeffsiver/fastapi-route-logger/tree/master/sample-site) in the code repository
contains a sample FastAPI site with this middleware integrated.
